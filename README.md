# Bayesian Estimation of Credit Conversion Factor (CCF)
This project is part of DSA 595 Bayesian computations for machine learning. 

This project implements a fully Bayesian modeling pipeline to estimate the **Credit Conversion Factor (CCF)** using real-world data from LendingClub. CCF is a key input in regulatory capital calculations under Basel III.
